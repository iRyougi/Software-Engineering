\chapter{Overview}
\section{Project description}
This project focuses on designing the architecture for four core modules: User, Service, Data, and Others (independent objects). Each subsystem's architecture will be visually represented, along with its persistent data tables, to ensure a clear and scalable system structure.

\section{Design purpose}
This design aims to establish a clear modular structure to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and focus separation of users, services, data, and other subsystems. By defining dedicated subsystems to construct different architecture layers and persistent data tables, it minimizes the number of associations across subsystem boundaries, ensures efficient data flow, reduces interdependencies, and simplifies future extensions.

\section{Design model}
\textbf{Layered Model} and \textbf{MVC Model} are used in this design.

The \textbf{Layered Model} divides the system into multiple levels: \textit{UserSub}, \textit{ServiceinfoSub}, \textit{DataUserSub}, and \textit{OthersSub}. The \textit{OthersSub} contains four parts: \textit{Data Sharing Policy}, \textit{Email}, \textit{Thesis}, and \textit{Student Record}. This structure helps clarify higher-level responsibilities and interactions.

The \textbf{MVC Model} consists of three subsystems: \textbf{Model}, \textbf{View}, and \textbf{Controller}. Changes in the \textbf{Model} are detected and displayed by the \textbf{View} subsystems, ensuring dynamic and responsive user interfaces.


\section{System architecture}

The architecture includes 4 subsystems. UserSub for role-based access (T-admin, E-admins, O-conveners), registration management, and organizational workspace oversight. ServiceinfoSub for course, thesis and student service configuration. DataUserSub for activity logs, user queries, and payment-service integration. OthersSub handles data policy updates, email operations, and thesis/student record storage with download capabilities.

\section{User Subsystem}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{picture/3-1/3-1-1.png}
    \caption{User Subsystem}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}

The system has the defualt User component which is then further classified into T-admin, E-admins or O-convener. E-admins can check Log information that records all user activity in the E-DBA, and can review Registration Applications submitted by O-conveners of each organization. O-conveners can submit Registration Applications that includes information of their organization for review, and can manage the Workspace belonging to that organization. The Workspace of each organization maintains a List of Members that can access the services provided by the Workspace and also has a Bank Account linked to it.

\subsection{Database}

    \caption{Service conf Subsystem}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}

This subsystem is divided into course configuration and interface configuration. The Private data provider can edit the course information service through this course configuration page. At the same time, he can configure and share thesis information and student information service through the interface configuration page.

\section{Data User}

    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}

Data User is the beginning of the subsystem, it can access activity record, user question, pay and service. Activity record, which is called LOG either, can store the data of the history of happened event. User question is a list that data user can see the questions that users ask. Service can be obtained after payment.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}

The other-subsystem contains 4 parts, data sharing policy, email, thesis and student record, the data sharing policy has title and content while it could be updated, the email has title, address, content while it could be sent or edit, the thesis has title, the student record belongs to a student record list while both thesis and student record could be downloaded.

\chapter{Assessment}

\section{Stability}
\textbf{Low Coupling}
The system employs a layered architecture, isolating UI components (e.g., PaymentUI) from persistence logic (e.g., CourseInfoMapper), minimizing ripple effects during modifications. Persistence layers focus on specific data domains, reducing dependencies.  

\textbf{High Cohesion }
Modules like UserSub (user registration) and DataUserSubsystem (log management) group related logic, while dedicated UIs (e.g., PaymentUI) partition business functions, ensuring focused responsibilities and consistency. 

\section{Reusability}
The system shows stable interfaces between layers, enabling components to be reused without modifications. The UI layer (e.g., PaymentUI, ServiceSelectionUI) interacts with backend logic via well-defined contracts, allowing UI replacements without disrupting underlying operations. Persistence components like CourseInfoMapper and PersistentLOG encapsulate domain-specific data handling, ensuring their interfaces remain consistent even when reused across subsystems (e.g., integrating user registration logic from UserSub into other modules). Modular design (e.g., DataUserSubsystem for logs) further supports reusability by grouping cohesive functionalities into self-contained units.

\section{Scalability} 
The system’s layered architecture and modular design (e.g., isolated UI, persistence layers) support vertical scaling (e.g., enhancing database performance). However, horizontal scaling (e.g., distributing workloads) may require decoupling tightly bound components like redundant numbered modules. Streamlining dependencies and standardizing interfaces would further improve flexibility for future expansion.
