\chapter{Introduction}

All external database interfaces mentioned in the document (such as the student information database, the degree thesis database, the bank account database, etc.) should be integrated and invoked according to the interfaces configured by the providers.

\section{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional, performance, and system constraints for the Educational Data Platform (E-DBA). It serves as a comprehensive reference for developers, testers, project managers, and other stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the system's expected behavior and requirements. This document will act as the foundation for system design, development, testing, and validation while ensuring that the implementation aligns with the specified business and technical needs.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document adheres to the following standardized conventions:

\subsection{Formatting and Typography}
The documentation maintains consistent typographic practices, with body text in a uniform font and size. Headings are bolded and organized in a hierarchical structure through section divisions to clarify content organization.

\subsection{Terminology Guidelines}
Key terms are consistently defined and formatted for clarity. For example, \textbf{data providers} and \textbf{data consumers} refer to user roles that supply data to the system and retrieve data from the system, respectively.

\subsection{Modular Structure}
Content is structured according to the system’s functional components and modules, such as user role management, data-sharing services, payment systems, and other operational divisions, ensuring logical separation and ease of navigation.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}

This document is intended for the following audience groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Managers and Developers:}  
    Should begin with the overview section to understand the system’s architecture and objectives, followed by the functional and technical requirements sections to gain insights into implementation details.  
    \item \textbf{System Administrators:}  
    Recommended to focus on the system configuration and management sections, including administrator privileges, security settings, and maintenance workflows.  
    \item \textbf{End Users (e.g., students, faculty, and staff):}  
    Advised to refer directly to the user guide and role-specific tutorials to learn how to access and utilize the E-DBA platform’s services effectively.  
\end{itemize}

By following these reading paths, each audience group can efficiently locate relevant information aligned with their roles and responsibilities.

\section{Project Scope}
The development of the E-DBA platform’s user interface, backend management system, and associated service modules, alongside the implementation of role-based access control for diverse user categories such as administrators, organizational coordinators, and data providers. Core functionalities include data provisioning and consumption mechanisms covering student identity verification, degree thesis access, and course information sharing, as well as the integration of a multi-payment-method online transaction system. Additionally, the platform will offer data warehousing capabilities to enable dataset export and collaborative sharing. Emphasis is placed on ensuring cross-institutional compatibility, robust data security protocols, and intuitive user experience design to streamline data interoperability and service delivery across participating educational organizations.

\section{References}
Foundational insights are drawn from the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) framework documentation, including its technical specifications and implementation guidelines for secure data exchange. Architectural principles align with the reference models and interoperability standards published by the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). Additionally, compliance considerations incorporate relevant educational data governance frameworks, cross-institutional data-sharing policies, and sector-specific regulatory requirements. Technical implementation details are informed by industry-standard development protocols, API integration best practices, and security benchmarks for distributed systems, ensuring alignment with modern data infrastructure paradigms.

\subsection{Basic Scenario}
The registration process initiates when the \textbf{O-Convener} completes the registration form (Step 1), providing contact information, institutional affiliation, and required documentation. Subsequently, the \textbf{E-Admin} or \textbf{Senior E-Admin} conducts a comprehensive review (Step 2), including material verification, authenticity validation, and background screening. Upon approval, system validation occurs (Step 3), generating a unique convener ID and activating service access privileges. Finalization (Step 4) triggers automated credential distribution and system onboarding initiation.

\subsection{Alternative Scenario}
\textbf{Registration Rejection:} In cases of administrative rejection, the system issues an automated notice detailing rejection rationale and appeal procedures, while preserving records for 30 days per GDPR compliance. \\
\textbf{Incomplete Submission:} System-level validation identifies missing elements through automated checks, flagging incomplete fields and initiating follow-up protocols requiring convener remediation before process continuation.
